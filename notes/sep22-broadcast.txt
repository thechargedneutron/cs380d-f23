Broadcast
=========
- Message from one node to all others in the system
- Broadcast consists of physical sending and receiving, and a "delivery"
- Types of broadcast: FIFO, Causal, Total Order
- Relationship between broadcast models: Best Effort, Reliable, FIFO, Causal, Total Order, FIFO-Total-Order
- Broadcast algorithm:
  - Send messages out pair-wise
  - Deliver messages based on the order we want
- Eager reliable broadcast: all nodes forward messages to all other nodes
  - not efficient
- Gossip protocols also achieve similar goal with higher efficiency
  - No guarantee that all nodes
- We build other algos on top of reliable broadcast
- FIFO Broadcast:
  - Each node uses a seq number, starting at 0
  - Each node keeps track of seq number of messages it delivered from each node
  - It only delivers a message N if it has delivered N-1 from that node
- Causal Broadcast:
  - Similar to FIFO Broadcast, using vectors instead of seq numbers
  - A node delivers a message Y only if its vector timestamp is later than the previous message X delivered
  - Note that Causal Broadcast is "global" while FIFO is "local"
- Total Order Broadcast
  - Single leader approach, all nodes send messages to leader, who serializes and broadcasts with FIFO broadcast
  - Has problem with leader dying or changing leader
  - Decentralized approach: attach vector clocks to all messages, deliver a message if every node has seen previous messages
